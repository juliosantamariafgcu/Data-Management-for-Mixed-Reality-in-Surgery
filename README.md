# Mixed-Reality-in-Surgical-Contexts
This repository will manage data that will be used for the research question: "How can Mixed Reality tools be implemented to support preoperative planning, intraoperative visualization, and training in surgery?". This data aims to comply to the F.A.I.R. guidelines. These guidelines being Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability

## Research Objectives

- Identify Gaps​: A systematic review of MR-related studies that focus on surgical planning, intraoperative visualization, and training. Identify gaps in Regulations, Workflow, and Humans.
- Analyze Gaps​: Analyze gaps into different categories and find proposed solutions within papers​.
- Framework Construction: Using everything learned, structure the basic plan for a general framework​.
- Validation: Refine the framework and validate it based on SUS, Learning Curve and Cost-effectiveness Ratio​.

## Methodology

- Data Collection: A systematic review of MR-related studies that focus on surgical planning, intraoperative visualization, and training.
- Gap Mapping: Using a gap matrix each reference will be mapped to one or more gap categories.
- Framework Construction: Implementation of a framework outlining the requirements, personnel, and infrastructure for MR adoption.
- Validation: Compare the developed framework against established success metrics and expert opinion when available.

## Significance

Using these findings, we can provide theoretical solutions for these gaps (based on real evidence), helping me make a stable, broad integration framework that will allow hospital to reap all the benefits that MR has to offer, while also reducing the number of gaps. This can in turn strengthen accuracy, surgical outcomes, and reduce overall costs.

## Contribution

This research is a significant contribution to the field because it can allow hospitals to use a guideline on how to properly implement MR into surgery with minimal gaps. Enhancing the ease of surgeons will increase accuracy of procedures, will reduce time limitations, and will help more people.
